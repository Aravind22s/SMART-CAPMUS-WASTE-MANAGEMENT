PROJECT OVERVIEW:           
*    The scope is to develop a prototype intelligent trash bin system using 
an ESP32, ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, resistor, and the Blynk app. The system 
will detect trash levels, automate lid opening/closing based on proximity, 
and provide real-time feedback on the Blynk app. The Blynk app will be 
integrated to allow remote monitoring and notifications, enabling users to 
view trash levels and receive alerts on their mobile devices.

YOU CAN ALSO MAKE IT AS HARDWARE PROJECT TOO       
*  A physical prototype of the smart trash bin system was developed, 
consisting of the following components:
      
 Esp32 board           
 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors (one for trash level detection, one for 
proximity detection)             
 LEDs               
 RESISTORs                
 Breadboard and jumper wires for circuit connections                
 
The prototype was assembled and tested to ensure the proper functioning 
of the trash level detection, automatic lid control, and user interface through 
the Blynk App.
